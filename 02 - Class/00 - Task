Implement an isAvailable instance method on the Car Class, which returns true, only if the car is clean, and has enough fuel in it - enough for at least 50 kms. Then implement a static method on the CarFinder class (getAvailable) which receives an array of character objects, a brand, and returns a number representing how many cars of that given brand is available.

array:
const c1 = new Car("Opel", true, 100)
const c2 = new Car("BMW", true, 100)
const c3 = new Car("Honda", true, 100)
const c4 = new Car("BMW", true, 100)
const c5 = new Car("BMW", true, 40)
const c6 = new Car("BMW", false, 100)
expect(CarFinder.getAvailable([c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6], "BMW")).to.equal(2);
